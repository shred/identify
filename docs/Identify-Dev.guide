ARexx
*****

Since V6.0 an ARexx function library is available. You can now also use Identify
in your ARexx scripts.

To do so, you just have to install the @{b}rexxidentify.library@{ub} into
@{b}libs:@{ub}. The library is included into ARexx by using a @{b}CALL
AddLib("/libs/rexxidentify.library",0,-30,0)@{ub} command.

These functions are available since Release 1:

@{b}ID_Release()@{ub}
     Returns the release- and version numbers of the
     @{b}rexxidentify.library@{ub}.  The format is: `@{b}<release>
     <version>.<revision>(<date>)@{ub}' (Example: `@{b}1 1.0(23.4.97)@{ub}'). You
     should use the @{b}<release>@{ub} part to check out if a function or option
     is available (e.g. @{b}Word(ID_Release(),1)@{ub}).  The result can also be
     easily split up into the single contents by using the @{b}PARSE@{ub}
     command.

@{b}ID_NumBoards()@{ub}
     Returns the number of expansion boards added to the system. You
     can easily construct a loop for @{b}ID_Expansion@{ub}, using this function.

@{b}ID_Expansion(<board>,<result code>)@{ub}
     Returns the appropriate result to the board number @{b}<board>@{ub} (0 to
     @{b}ID_NumBoards()@{ub}-1) and the @{b}<result code>@{ub}. Result codes are:
    @{b}MANUF@{ub}
          Manufacturer name

    @{b}PROD@{ub}
          Product name

    @{b}CLASS@{ub}

    @{b}SIZE@{ub}
          Reserved amount of memory for the expansion board (decimal,
          KBytes)

    @{b}SHUTUP@{ub}
          Has the expansion been shut up? (0:No, 1:Yes)

    @{b}SECONDARY@{ub}
          (since Release 4) Checks if the entry is primary (Result:
          @{b}Primary@{ub}) or secondary (Result: @{b}Secondary@{ub}).

    @{b}CLASSID@{ub}
          (since Release 5) Returns the Class ID of the expansion
          board, see include files (decimal).

@{b}ID_Function(<library>,<offset>)@{ub}
     Returns the name of the @{b}<library>@{ub}'s function and the offset
     @{b}<offset>@{ub}. See the Shell program @{b}Function@{ub}.

@{b}ID_Alert(<code>,<result code>)@{ub}
     Returns the appropriate result to the alert code @{b}<code>@{ub}
     (hexadecimal string) and the @{b}<result code>@{ub}. Result codes are:
    @{b}DEAD@{ub}
          Deadend or Recovery?

    @{b}SUBSYS@{ub}
          System causing the alert

    @{b}GENERAL@{ub}

InstallIfy
**********

Since V9.0, a new tool has been added.

InstallIfy allows you to import identify's hardware information into
Installer scripts.

So you can find out in an Installer script, if e.g. a PowerPC is available,
what PowerPC OS is used, or if sufficient processor power is available.

InstallIfy should be invoked with the installer's RUN function. The
name for the desired hardware information is provided, and the
appropriate numerical result is returned as DOS return code. For
example:

     (set rc (run "c:InstallIfy POWERPC" (safe)))
     (if (<> rc 0)       ; PowerPC
       (message "A PowerPC is available!")
     )

These options are available:

@{b}FIELD@{ub}
     Here, the name of the desired hardware field is passed. This are
     the same as for the ARexx @{b}ID_Hardware@{ub} command. See the include
     files to find out how the return code has to be interpreted.

@{b}UPDATE@{ub}
     If this option is set, the @{b}identify.library@{ub} hardware information
     cache will be flushed. Use this option wisely, see @{b}ListExp@{ub}.

@{b}HELP@{ub}
     Shows a short help page and exits.

There is an example Installer script in the developer packet. Just have a look
at it and see how InstallIfy is used.

Migration Notes
***************

Here you will find some developer's notes about how to update your code to support
a newer version of Identify. Usually we do our best to keep downward compatibility,
but that's not always possible.

@{i}V 38.0@{ui}
        @{b}*@{ub} The constant IDDN_8364 was obviously wrong, as Lisa has the
          chip ID 4203, while 8364 has always referred to Paula. For this reason,
          the constant has been removed and replaced with IDDN_4203. Please use
          this constant instead.
